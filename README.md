# Overview:

  This is Back-End project, deals with weather API, that depends on Java-Script and Node-JS and use some tools, like "express", "body-parser",and "cors".
 
## used technology:

* We created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
* We used ES6 when writing the code.
* We made some modifying to HTML and CSS files to make the layout more simple as I can.
* We added a small tag to display the error message which comes from API.
* We used extention on the URL (&units=metric) to get the Celsius Temperature.
* We wrote comments to make the code more readable.
