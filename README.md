 // Weather-Journal App Project //

  This is my second project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

 
 // Overview // 

* I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
* I used ES6 when writing the code.
* I made some modifying to HTML and CSS files to make the layout more simple as I can.
* I added a small tag to display the error message which comes from API.
* I used extention on the URL (&units=metric) to get the Celsius Temperature.
* I wrote comments to make the code more readable.

 // How to use // 

* All you should do is write the ZIP code of the city (United States).
* You can write your feelings if you want [optional].
* The application will show you.
  - the name of the city. 
  - the temperature.
  - the date.
  - description of weather.
  - your feelings.
